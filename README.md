## To Do

- Handle image size better. Currently the bundle (and project itself) is far too big because we're using large hi-res images. Possible solutions: LFS, manually resize images based on breakpoints, use grayscale images, dynamic resizing during builds, i.e. ImageMagick.
- Remove placeholder SCSS and integrate it into component structure better.
- Refactor everything
