    body: `The mission of the Hello World Initiative is to create an inclusive, welcoming, productive environment for anyone who wants to learn to code. We understand that traditional educational paths aren’t for everyone, and we’re building a community for those who don’t have the means to attend college or a bootcamp. As a group of largely self-taught coders, we’ve collectively spent years discovering what works and what doesn’t, and we’re dedicated to helping others find their own path into the tech industry. We believe that anyone who wants to learn should have access to the resources they need. Whether you’ve never written a line of code in your life or you’re a longtime industry professional, we want to help you meet your goals.`

        `We believe that no matter who you are and what resources you have available, you can learn to code. The tech industry needs people from a variety of backgrounds and walks of life, and our goal is to make sure people feel welcome and included while they learn to code. Have a question that you’re embarrassed to ask? We won’t judge. Did you make something that doesn’t feel “good enough”? We believe small wins are just as important as big ones. The tech industry needs people like you, and so do we.`,
        `The Hello World Initiative is not a bootcamp or a company trying to push a certain product - it’s a community. We’re a group of people who meet to support each other, help each other learn, and create projects that foster learning. We think that having a supportive community is one of the most important aspects of learning to code, so we created a space where people can ask for help, find partners to work on projects, and answer questions to solidify their understanding of the topics they’re working on.`,
        `Whenever possible, we recommend free and open source courses and learning materials. When we use paid resources, generally the cost will be well under $50, and we’ll do our best to provide a free alternative as well. Any cost for resources is totally optional and goes to the creators - we do this because we want to help, not to make money. College and bootcamps are huge investments - we want to ensure that everyone who has a desire to learn about technology has access to the resources they need. Talent is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not. We believe it’s possible to change that.`

      body: `Learning to code can be isolating - it’s easy to feel like you’re not getting it and that tech just isn’t for you. That’s why we created this community. We think that learning coding - or anything else - is easier and more fun when you do it with other people. Our Discord channel is a place for people to ask questions, help each other, and talk about their progress through whatever curriculum they’ve chosen. Most of all, it’s a place where you never have to worry about being judged for not knowing the answer. We were all beginners once, and we believe everyone has something valuable to contribute.`

These weekly meetups are held at a coffee shop in the Richardson, TX area, although we are working on more structured events in the future.`
